# Welcome to MaterialJS

Inspired by [Google's Material 3 Design System](https://m3.material.io/), MaterialJS is a framework that offers both CSS and [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) component libraries.
MaterialJS supports [Google Fonts icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons), [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/), and a pure CSS library for community development. A [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/) image is available that builds a ready to go container for local development and cloud providers. The tech stack is: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en), 
[Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), [Koa](https://koajs.com/), and [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/). Everything is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
